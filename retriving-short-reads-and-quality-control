# Now we are going to download our short reads and do some quality control.
# I mounted a hard disk (1TB) at "/assembly" and made a directory called "/assembly/sga-assembly/pichia"
# To download our sequences we are going to use NCBI's Short Read Assembly (SRA) toolkit.
# In the depencencies step we downloaded this tool.

# I started by making a directory to place our data in
# We are going to assemble pichia pastourus as a test run.

sudo mkdir /assembly/sga-assembly/pichia/shortreads

cd /assembly/sga-assembly/pichia/shortreads

# We are going to assemble pichia pastourus as a test run. The first step is to downlload our short
# reads from NCBI's server.
